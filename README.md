# Project 2 - World

Submitted by: **Grace Caie**

**Wordle** is an app that allows users to guess a five-letter word within six guesses. Each guess, the app will tell the user whether each of the letters in the word they guessed is in the word and whether it's in the correct spot. In this version, the number of letters, number of guesses, and theme can be changed. Additionally, there is an alien mode where the goal word changes every guess.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes

It was confusing making sure the optionals were actual values and not none but the hints helped.
